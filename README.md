Given input image as ascii art, generate an image

* <strike>code for generating indexed png with two color (hints: rfc 1950, zlib, deflate)</strike>
* depending on lot of compiler optimizatio, which I guess is okay
* restructure code, better code, remove hardcoding
* currently generating a static image
